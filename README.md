# Contact Tracker
Individual Project created 23 December 2016

INTRODUCTION: (Updated)
--------------------
This is a Single Page AngularJS 1.5/JavaScript/jQuery project application.  Front-end logic with AngularJS/JavaScript/Jquery was designed, built, and deployed to cloud services over a period of 1 day.

HOW TO USE:
---------------------
This is a basic task orginzer/tracker. The buttons are user friendly and fairly self-explanatory i.e. the "add contact" button adds contacts with the text the user inputs.  Contacts can be deleted, updated, and checked as completed.  A counter at the top keeps track of the total number of contacts.


NOTE TO USER:
---------------------
This is an ongoing project designed to teach Skill Distillery students new to AngularJS 1.5.  There is currently no back-end logic implemented i.e. no persistence of data via MySQL and JPA.  This will be implemented in 2017 once class resumes.  If time allows I will also implement UI BootStrap in this application for a more seamless execution with its native framework AngularJS.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
-----------------
1.  Front-end logic and data storage was executed using JavaScript, jQuery, and AngularJS 1.5.

2.  Bootstrap was used for front-end design and operations such as regular expressions for exception prevention and dynamically populated fields and drop-down lists were implemented using HTML5 and CSS3 and AngularJS 1.5.

6.  Apache Tomcat is used as the server for execution and JavaScript handles server/client requests.

7.  Spring/REST will be the framework used for dynamic management of objects with Spring Entity Manager and the Hibernate dependency.

8.  The application is deployed on a AWS account for cloud services.
